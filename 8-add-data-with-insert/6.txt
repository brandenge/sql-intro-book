PostgreSQL will throw an error because the "last_name" column has a NOT NULL constraint, and that column does not have any data for both rows being inserted.

Below is the INSERT statement:

INSERT INTO celebrities (first_name, date_of_birth, occupation, deceased)
VALUES ('Madonna', '08/16/1958', 'Singer, Actress', false),
       ('Prince', '06/07/1958', 'Singer, Songwriter, Musician, Actor', true);

Below is the error message returned in output:

ERROR:  null value in column "last_name" of relation "celebrities" violates not-null constraint
DETAIL:  Failing row contains (5, Madonna, Singer, Actress, 1958-08-16, f, null).
